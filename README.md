## Method/capabilities

WaterLily solves the unsteady incompressible 2D or 3D [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) on a Cartesian grid. The pressure Poisson equation is solved with a [geometric multigrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigrid_method) method. Solid boundaries are modelled using the [Boundary Data Immersion Method](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/369635/). The solver can run on serial CPU, multi-threaded CPU, or GPU backends.

## Example: Flow over a circle

WaterLily lets the user can set the domain size and boundary conditions, the fluid viscosity (which determines the [Reynolds number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number)), and immerse solid obstacles. A large selection of examples, notebooks, and tutorials are found in the [WaterLily-Examples](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily-Examples) repository. Here, we will illustrate the basics by simulating and plotting the flow over a circle.

We define the size of the simulation domain as `n` by `m` cells. The circle has radius `m/8` and is centered at `(m/2,m/2)`. The flow boundary conditions are `(U,0)`, where we set `U=1`, and the Reynolds number is `Re=U*radius/Î½` where `Î½` (Greek "nu" U+03BD, not Latin lowercase "v") is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
```julia
using WaterLily
function circle(n,m;Re=100,U=1)
    # signed distance function to circle
    radius, center = m/8, m/2-1
    sdf(x,t) = âˆšsum(abs2, x .- center) - radius

    Simulation((n,m),   # domain size 
               (U,0),   # domain velocity (& velocity scale)
               2radius; # length scale
               Î½=U*2radius/Re,     # fluid viscosity 
               body=AutoBody(sdf)) # geometry
end
```
The circle geometry is defined using a [signed distance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function#Applications). The `AutoBody` function uses [automatic differentiation](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/) to infer the other geometric parameters of the body automatically. Replace the circle's distance function with any other, and now you have the flow around something else... such as a [donut](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily-Examples/blob/main/examples/ThreeD_Donut.jl) or the [Julia logo](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily-Examples/blob/main/examples/TwoD_Julia.jl). For more complex geometries, [ParametricBodies.jl](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/ParametricBodies.jl) defines a `body` using any parametric curve, such as a spline. See that repo (and the video above) for examples. 

The code block above return a `Simulation` with the parameters we've defined. Now we can initialize a simulation (first line) and step it forward in time (second line)
```julia
circ = circle(3*2^5,2^6)
sim_step!(circ)
```
Note we've set `n,m` to be multiples of powers of 2, which is important when using the (very fast) geometric multi-grid solver.

We can now access and plot whatever variables we like. For example, we can plot the x-component of the velocity field using
```julia
using Plots
u = circ.flow.u[:,:,1] # first component is x
contourf(u') # transpose the array for the plot
```
![Initial velocity field](assets/u0.png)

As you can see, the velocity within the circle is zero, the velocity far from the circle is one, and there are accelerated and decelerated regions around the circle. The `sim_step!` has only taken a single time step, and this initial flow around our circle looks similar to the potential flow because the viscous boundary layer has not separated yet. 

A set of [flow metric functions](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl/blob/master/src/Metrics.jl) have been implemented, and we can use them to measure the simulation. The following code block defines a function to step the simulation to time `t` and then use the `pressure_force` metric to measure the force on the immersed body. The function is applied over a time range, and the forces are plotted. 
```Julia
function get_forces!(sim,t)
    sim_step!(sim,t,remeasure=false)
    force = WaterLily.pressure_force(sim)
    force./(0.5sim.L*sim.U^2) # scale the forces!
end

# Simulate through the time range and get forces
time = 1:0.1:50 # time scale is sim.L/sim.U
forces = [get_forces!(circ,t) for t in time];

#Plot it
plot(time,[first.(forces), last.(forces)], 
    labels=permutedims(["drag","lift"]),
    xlabel="tU/L",
    ylabel="Pressure force coefficients")
```
![Pressure forces](assets/forces.png)

We can also plot the vorticity field instead of the u-velocity to see a snap-shot of the wake.

```julia
# Use curl(velocity) to compute vorticity `inside` the domain
Ï‰ = zeros(size(u));
@inside Ï‰[I] = WaterLily.curl(3,I,circ.flow.u)*circ.L/circ.U

# Plot it
clims = (-6,6)
contourf(clamp.(Ï‰,clims...)'; clims,
    color=palette(:RdBu,9),linewidth=0,levels=8,
    aspect_ratio=:equal,border=:none)
```

As you can see, WaterLily correctly predicts that the flow is unsteady, with an alternating vortex street wake, leading to an oscillating side force and drag force.

## Multi-threading and GPU backends

WaterLily uses [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl) to multi-thread on CPU and run on GPU backends. The implementation method and speed-up are documented in the [2024 paper](https://physics.paperswithcode.com/paper/waterlily-jl-a-differentiable-and-backend), with costs as low as 1.44 nano-seconds measured per degree of freedom and time step!

Note that multi-threading requires _starting_ Julia with the `--threads` argument, see [the multi-threading section](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/) of the manual. If you are running Julia with multiple threads, KernelAbstractions will detect this and multi-thread the loops automatically. 

Running on a GPU requires initializing the `Simulation` memory on the GPU, and care needs to be taken to move the data back to the CPU for visualization. As an example, let's compare a **3D** GPU simulation of a sphere to the **2D** multi-threaded CPU circle defined above
```Julia
using CUDA,WaterLily
function sphere(n,m;Re=100,U=1,T=Float64,mem=Array)
    radius, center = m/8, m/2-1
    body = AutoBody((x,t)->âˆšsum(abs2, x .- center) - radius)
    Simulation((n,m,m),(U,0,0), # 3D array size and BCs
                2radius;Î½=U*2radius/Re,body, # no change
                T,   # Floating point type
                mem) # memory type
end

@assert CUDA.functional()      # is your CUDA GPU working?? 
GPUsim = sphere(3*2^5,2^6;T=Float32,mem=CuArray); # 3D GPU sim!
println(length(GPUsim.flow.u)) # 1.3M degrees-of freedom!
sim_step!(GPUsim)              # compile GPU code & run one step
@time sim_step!(GPUsim,50,remeasure=false) # 40s!!

CPUsim = circle(3*2^5,2^6);    # 2D CPU sim
println(length(CPUsim.flow.u)) # 0.013M degrees-of freedom!
sim_step!(CPUsim)              # compile GPU code & run one step
println(Threads.nthreads())    # I'm using 8 threads
@time sim_step!(CPUsim,50,remeasure=false) # 28s!!
```
As you can see, the 3D sphere set-up is almost identical to the 2D circle, but using 3D arrays means there are almost 1.3M degrees-of-freedom, 100x bigger than in 2D. Never the less, the simulation is quite fast on the GPU, only around 40% slower than the much smaller 2D simulation on a CPU with 8 threads. See the [2024 paper](https://physics.paperswithcode.com/paper/waterlily-jl-a-differentiable-and-backend) and the [examples repo](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily-Examples) for many more non-trivial examples including running on AMD GPUs.

Finally, KernelAbstractions does incur some CPU allocations for every loop, but other than this `sim_step!` is completely non-allocating. This is one reason why the speed-up improves as the size of the simulation increases.
